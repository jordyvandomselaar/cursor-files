# commit

Create a commit using the branch name as the commit message's prefix. Use the following format:

```
<branch-name>: <commit-message>
```

For example, if the branch name is `feature/add-code-asset`, the commit message should be:

```
feature/add-code-asset: Add code asset
```

The commit message should be a short description of the changes made in the branch. When possible, prefer listing logic
changes, breaking changes, and new features.
